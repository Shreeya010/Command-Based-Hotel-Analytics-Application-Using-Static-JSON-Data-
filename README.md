# Hotel Analytics System

A Python-based Hotel Analytics System to track sales, cancelled bills, and predict potential bill cancellations using simple ML logic.

## Project Overview

This project allows hotel managers to:

- View today's total sales  
- Generate payment-wise sales reports  
- Check cancelled bills  
- Predict the probability of bill cancellations using a simple ML model  

The system is designed to be easy to run and extend. The ML logic is currently a placeholder function that can be replaced with a trained model using historical hotel transaction data.  

A sample dataset (`data/sample_data.csv`) is included for testing purposes.
